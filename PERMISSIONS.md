#### Vetoer
Velodrome team at deployment of VeloGovernor. At a later date, this role will be renounced.

At first deployment, team.

#### EpochGovernor
At first deployment, team. Before the tail rate of emissions is reached, this will be set to [EpochGovernor](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/contracts/blob/contracts-v2/contracts/EpochGovernor.sol).

#### Allowed Manager
At first deployment, team. This role will likely be given to a contract so that it can create managed nfts (e.g. for autocompounders etc)

#### Fee Manager
